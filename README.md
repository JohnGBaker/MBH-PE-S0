## Planned plots

### LISA geometry

* LISA on its orbits
* Lframe definition

### Signal morphology

* FD spectrum SMBH + noise overlayed + different harmonics plotted + FD transfer functions
* FD spectrum SOBH + noise overlayed + different harmonics plotted + FD transfer functions
* TD SMBH signal, whitened ?
* TD SOBH signal, whitened ?
* SNR(f) different M (also IMBH) + different harmonics
* SNR(t) different M (also IMBH) + different harmonics -- different plot for merger not in band SOBH ?

### PE SMBH

#### PE non-degenerate case

* full corner plot : Lframe, 22/HM vs bambi/ptmcmc, 4 overlayed ? + Fisher matrix -- show only one sampler if they agree ?
* table for likelihood/sampler performance

#### PE refinement with time

* table time/SNR
* sky map Mollweide
* zoom : (m1,m2), (dL, inc), (lambda, beta)

#### PE refinement with distance (move to Appendix ?)

* table dist/SNR
* sky map Mollweide
* zoom : (m1,m2), (dL, inc), (lambda, beta)

#### PE Highlighting degeneracies

* full corner plot : Lframe, 22/HM vs bambi/ptmcmc, no Fisher ? Contours only ?
* extrinsic corner plot simple likelihood 22 : bambi vs ptmcmc
* zoom sky position : real likelihood + simple likelihood + prediction of degenerate spot
* show e.g. sky position with simple likelihood 22+33 to show degeneracy is broken

### PE SOBH

* full corner plot : SSB frame, 22, bambi/ptmcmc and Fisher -- ptmcmc and Fisher to be completed
* table for likelihood/sampler performance
